# Requirements

## Running the App

For running the app, you need:

- Android device running Android 7.0 (Nougat) or higher (API level 24+)
- Storage access for video files and playlists

Pre-built APKs are available from the [Releases page](https://github.com/slhck/SubjectivePlayer/releases/latest). These are unsigned builds.

## Building from Source

If you want to make changes to the functionality, you need to build the app yourself. You'll need:

- Android SDK with:
    - Build Tools 34.0.0 or higher
    - Platform SDK 35 (Android 15) or higher
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
- Gradle 8.9 or higher (included via wrapper)

See the [Building](../developer-guide/building.md) guide for more information.
